My name is Patrik. I make beats!

- I work fast with my tools of choice.
- I am flexible in meeting my clients needs.
- I have 3 years of arranging, mixing and mastering hip hop beats under my belt.

I create beats and work with local rappers in Link√∂ping. I am a DJ for a hobby. I am flexible in my domain yet I try new things all the time. I tend to be altruistic in my endeavours with other people. I have good communication skills and mediator knowhow.

### My History

In 2015 I started my journey in creating music. I bought the "FL Studio" Digital Audio Workstation, and shortly thereafter my first keyboard, the Nektartech LX-61. I began learning a lot about the field, and went to an event arrangement workshop in 2016. I began to host DJ events, where I learned how to DJ properly. When I aquired my first DJ mixer table, things took a faster pace. I quickly began learning the ins and outs of "FL Studio", the Numark DJ table and keyboard, and sooner rather than later I met my first colleague, a swedish rapper. I was working very closely with him during the full year of 2017, and eventually, in 2018, the team released on Spotify and physical CD. From then onwards, my almost daily practice has been to continue learning how to create good music, in particular Hip Hop Beats. I work weekly with the same rapper I met back in 2016, continuing our musical journey together.
